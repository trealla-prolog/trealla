% Actors on tasks rather than threads - same shape as library(actors/threads),
% different backend, so skynet-sized actor counts stay off the OS
% thread ceiling. Pid is a qid (task_self/1, task_create/2), not a
% thread id: the two libraries' Pids are not interchangeable, and
% neither is a drop-in replacement for the other - see
% docs/DESIGN-GUSTTO.md phase 5 for why both are kept.
%
% No handshake needed for spawn+link atomicity, unlike the thread
% version: tasks on one OS thread run cooperatively, so a freshly
% task_create/2'd child provably has not run a single instruction by
% the time task_create/2 returns - nothing yields between the spawn and
% the link below. A short-lived thread can die before its creator
% installs a link; a short-lived task cannot outrun code that has not
% yielded yet.
%
% recv/1 does not block (it never did, even before GUSTTO) and still
% does not - task_actor_recv/1,2 use recv/2 instead, which parks the
% task (do_yield(), the same mechanism thread_get_message/3's blocking
% form uses) rather than spinning. No CPU spent polling: a task
% waiting on a message costs nothing until send/2 wakes it, or its
% timeout elapses.

% A minimal supervisor, straight port of library(actors/threads)'s:
% one_for_one, link to each child, restart the one that dies, with a
% restart budget - max_restarts(N) within period(Seconds), default 5
% in 5 - so a child that dies immediately on start spins forever
% instead of taking the supervisor down with it. Exhausting it stops
% the supervisor. What made this port possible is task_cancel/1: the
% thread version leans on thread_cancel/1 to kill the children when
% stopping or when the budget is blown, and until task_cancel/1
% existed there was no equivalent for a task.
%
% One thing the port does not get for free: a thread-based supervisor
% runs in the background just by existing - it is a real, preemptively
% scheduled thread. A task-based one only makes progress while its
% owning thread drives the scheduler (wait/0, or a caller that keeps
% yielding it turns), so task_supervisor_start/2,3 called directly from
% a thread that then goes on to do other things leaves it starved -
% spawned, registered, never actually run. Host it on a thread of its
% own instead:
%

%
%   task_self(Me), thread_create(sup_host(Children, Opts, Me), _, []),
%   recv(sup(Sup), [timeout(5.0)])
%
% which gets the supervisor and everything under it its own thread to
% run on indefinitely, exactly as a thread-based supervisor already
% has, while the caller stays free.
