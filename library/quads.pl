/** Quads: queries using answer descriptions.

  Quads are embedded tests: a '?- Query.' term in a source file
  followed by a term describing the expected toplevel answers.
  See https://github.com/trealla-prolog/trealla/issues/1063

  When a file is consulted the compiler records each quad as a fact

      '$quad'(Id, Query, VarNames, AnswerDescription, File, Line)

  in the module being consulted, Id being the label of a quad written
  'Name ?- Query.' and unbound otherwise. Nothing is executed at load
  time.
  This library interprets the recorded quads as tests:

      ?- use_module(library(quads)).
      ?- run_quads.             % run quads recorded in module user
      ?- run_quads(mymod).      % run quads recorded in some module

  run_quads/0 and run_quads/1 always succeed and print a report.
  run_quads_halt/0 halts the system with a non-zero exit code if
  any quad failed, for use in scripts:

      tpl file.pl -g 'use_module(library(quads)), run_quads_halt'

  Answer description syntax (see the issue for the full grammar):

      ?- member(X, [1,2,3]).
         X = 1
      ;  X = 2
      ;  X = 3.

  A quad may be labelled with a ground term, which reports name it:

      member_1 ?- member(X, [1,2,3]).
         X = 1
      ;  X = 2
      ;  X = 3.

      ?- fail.
         false.

      ?- atom_length(A, L).
         error(instantiation_error, _).

      ?- repeat.
         true
      ;  true
      ;  ... .

  ... accepts any further answers, and so does ad_infinitum, which
  states that there are infinitely many of them:

      ?- repeat.
         true
      ;  ad_infinitum.

  Both are annotations, so either may also be written as a conjunct of
  the last answer described ('X = 1, ... .').

  A query that does not terminate is described by loops:

      ?- repeat, fail.
         loops.

  Alternative acceptable outcomes are separated by (|)/2.

  other_answer_sequence marks that the answers of the companion
  alternative may appear in any order (ISO setof/3, 8.10.3). It is
  well formed only with a single alternative of at least two leaf
  answers (issue #1096):

      ?- setof(1, (Y=2 ; Y=1), L).
         Y = 2, L = [1]
      ;  Y = 1, L = [1]
      |  other_answer_sequence.

  A quad may carry more than one answer description; all of them
  must hold.

  An answer description annotated with 'unexpected' (or its synonym
  'inattendue') describes an answer that must *not* occur:

      ?- X = 1.
         X = 2, unexpected.

  The annotation sto is recognised but such (parts of) descriptions
  are currently skipped, not interpreted.

  outputs/1 records what the query writes to current output (issue
  #1082). Its argument is matched against the captured characters; a
  character list or double-quoted string is accepted for now (a DCG
  body also works via phrase/2). It is a conjunct of the answer, as in
  the English answer descriptions of ISO 13211-1:

      ?- write(abc), nl.
         outputs("abc\n"),
         true.

  An answer reports an answer *substitution*, so each equation binds a
  variable and no variable is bound twice within one answer. '1 = X'
  and 'X = 1, X = 2' are rejected as malformed, not run as tests.

  In a binding, ... stands for an unspecified subterm (issue #1088):

      ?- X = 1.
         X = ... .

      ?- length(L, 999).
         L = [_A,_B,_C|...].

  maybe marks that the answer leaves some variable of the query
  attributed - a constraint (dif, clpz, or any other attribute module)
  is still pending on it. It says only that one exists, not which:

      ?- dif(X, Y), X = a.
         X = a, maybe.

  Unlike unexpected/sto/... it is not stripped as a bare annotation:
  it is itself part of what the answer asserts, so 'maybe.' alone
  (no bindings at all) is also a valid, checked description.
