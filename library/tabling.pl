% incremental(+Spec) - ":- incremental(q/1)" marks a DYNAMIC predicate
% as one whose assert/retract invalidates the tables that consulted it.
% `incremental` is not a known directive, so the loader runs it as an
% ordinary goal and this needs no parser support (unlike SWI's
% ":- dynamic q/1 as incremental", whose `as` lands in the parser's
% predicate-indicator error path).
%
% Deliberately NOT a prefix operator, so the parens are required. At a
% priority loose enough for ":- incremental q/1" it could no longer
% appear as the right operand of `as` (xfx 700, max 699), which is
% exactly where ":- table p/1 as incremental" needs it - and it would
% make a common word an operator for every user of this library.
%
% Both halves must opt in: this one, and ":- table p/1 as incremental"
% on the table side. A table only collects dependencies if it is
% incremental, and only on predicates that are.

% require the OUTER functor to literally be '/' or '//'. Excluding
% those shapes here too (and `as`/2, handled just above) means a
% malformed Name/Arity (eg. foo/bar, Arity not an integer) still falls
% through to no clause matching at all - today's behaviour - rather
% than being silently misread as a mode spec for a predicate
% confusingly named '/'.
%
% Exactly one argument may be `min` or `max` (aggregated); every other
% argument, `_` by convention, is part of the dedup KEY. Recommended by
% the design doc as the first cut: monotone, so the fixpoint argument
% stays simple - a general user-supplied lattice is not attempted.
