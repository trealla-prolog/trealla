% Janus Prolog-Python interface - phases 0 and 1.
%
% See docs/janus-design.md. Phase 0 is the build wiring, finding
% libpython, the shutdown hook and py_version/0. Phase 1 is the
% marshaller: the bi-translation table of the design's section 3, both
% directions, recursive. Calling and iteration arrive in phases 2-3.
%
% REFERENCE OWNERSHIP, which is the rule everything here obeys:
%
%   - pl_to_py/2 returns a NEW reference. The caller owns it and must
%     Py_DecRef it.
%   - py_to_pl/2 BORROWS its object. It never releases what it was
%     given; the caller keeps ownership. The one exception is the
%     fallback to '$py_obj'/1, which increfs so the handle owns a
%     reference of its own, released by py_free/1 in phase 4.
%   - Whether an entry point returns a new or a borrowed reference is a
%     property of the function, not of the value, so it is recorded in
%     py_sig/3 below and never decided at the call site.
%   - PyList_SetItem and PyTuple_SetItem STEAL their reference; the
%     other containers do not, so what goes into a dict or a set is
%     released afterwards and what goes into a list or tuple is not.
%
% Nothing here is reachable from a default build: the module is only
% embedded when built with `make janus`, so a stock `make` carries no
% reference to Python of any kind.

%   py_is_object/1 goes false afterwards. A Prolog term cannot be cleared
%   from under its copies, so this one cannot. See the ownership rule in
%   section 3 of docs/janus-design.md: using a handle after freeing it is
%   a program error the same way use-after-free is, and detecting it by

%   needs this.
%
%   Freeing twice, or using the handle afterwards, is undefined in the
%   same way free() twice is. That is the price of a term the runtime
