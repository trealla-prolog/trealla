# macOS counterpart to run_valgrind.sh - see that file for the test-pass
# contract (output must match AND the run must exit cleanly).
#
# Unlike valgrind, `leaks --atExit` writes its own report into the SAME
# stdout stream as the child, interleaved after the child's own output -
# there is no clean-stdout/diagnostics-on-stderr split to rely on. So
# each .pl source runs TWICE: once plain, to capture output for the
# diff; once under `leaks --atExit`, purely to read its leak count off
# the "Process N: <count> leaks for ..." line. Prolog test sources are
# deterministic, so the doubled run costs time, not correctness.
#
# .sh sources are run plain only, no leak check. `leaks --atExit` hooks
# the exit of the one process it launches; it does not follow children.
# A .sh test typically forks a chain of its own (subshells, cc/clang/ld,
# background tpl instances) - wrapping that chain in leaks doesn't
# check tpl, it drowns the run in unrelated MallocStackLogging noise
# from every process in it and reports on whichever one happens to be
# in front when the wrapper exits. run_valgrind.sh has the identical
# gap (no --trace-children), just silently: valgrind's report on an
# idle sh wrapper is a harmless "0 errors," not noise or a false leak.
