# A test passes only if BOTH its output matches and it exited cleanly.
#
# Checking the diff alone lets a crash on the way out score as a pass:
# the program prints every expected line, then dies in shutdown, and
# `diff` is perfectly happy. That is not hypothetical - a segfault in
# test107 was invisible here for exactly this reason. Every test runs
# under `-g halt`, so a clean run always exits 0 and this adds no noise.
