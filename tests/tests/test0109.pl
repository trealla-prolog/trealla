% Clauses with a var in an indexed argument must still be found once a
% predicate crosses the dynamic index threshold (500). idx1 is keyed on
% Arg1 and idx2 on Arg2, and index_cmpkey() calls a var equal to
% anything, so a var-headed argument breaks the skiplist's ordering and
% the descent can walk straight past the clause.
