% Issue #1127: dif/2 silently posted no constraint when the variable it
% had to delay on already carried an attribute.
%
% '$undo_trail'/2 marks a cyclically-bound variable's occurrences inside
% its own value (FLAG_VAR_CYCLIC) so that term_variables/2 called from
% verify_attributes/3 skips the variable being bound - see tests/tests/
% test0098.pl, which is what the mark was added for. The mark was never
% cleared, so it stayed on the heap cells afterwards and hid that
% variable from every later term_variables/2.
%
% dif(A,C) tests A \= C first; with B attributed that unification runs
% the post-unify hook, which left the mark on the B inside A. dif/2's
% own term_variables(dif(A,C),Vars) then found [] instead of [B] and
% dif_set_variables/3 stored nothing, so dif(A,C) succeeded
% unconstrained and B=[[]|B] had nothing left to check.

% B=[[]|B] makes A and C both the infinite list of [], so A == C and
